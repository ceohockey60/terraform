# Function Calls

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Perform Dynamic Operations with Functions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/functions?in=terraform/configuration-language&utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial on HashiCorp Learn.

The Terraform language has a number of
[built-in functions](/docs/language/functions/index.html) that can be used
in expressions to transform and combine values. These
are similar to the operators but all follow a common syntax:

```hcl
<FUNCTION NAME>(<ARGUMENT 1>, <ARGUMENT 2>)
```

The function name specifies which function to call. Each defined function
expects a specific number of arguments with specific value types, and returns a
specific value type as a result.

Some functions take an arbitrary number of arguments. For example, the `min`
function takes any amount of number arguments and returns the one that is
numerically smallest:

```hcl
min(55, 3453, 2)
```

A function call expression evaluates to the function's return value.

## Available Functions

For a full list of available functions, see
[the function reference](/docs/language/functions/index.html).

## Expanding Function Arguments

If the arguments to pass to a function are available in a list or tuple value,
that value can be _expanded_ into separate arguments. Provide the list value as
an argument and follow it with the `...` symbol:

```hcl
min([55, 2453, 2]...)
```

The expansion symbol is three periods (`...`), not a Unicode ellipsis character
(`â€¦`). Expansion is a special syntax that is only available in function calls.

## Using Sensitive Data as Function Arguments

When using sensitive data, such as [an input variable](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html#suppressing-values-in-cli-output)
or [an output defined](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/outputs.html#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output) as sensitive
as function arguments, the result of the function call will be marked as sensitive.

This is a conservative behavior that is true irrespective of the function being
called. For example, passing an object containing a sensitive input variable to
the `keys()` function will result in a list that is sensitive:

```shell
> local.baz
{
  "a" = (sensitive)
  "b" = "dog"
}
> keys(local.baz)
(sensitive)
```
